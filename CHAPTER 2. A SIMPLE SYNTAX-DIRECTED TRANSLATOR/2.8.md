### 2.8.1
***
For-statements in C and Java have the form:
```
        for ( expr1 ; expr2 ; expr3 ) stmt
```
The first expression is executed before the loop; it is typically used for initializating the loop index. The second expression is a test made before each iteration of the loop; the loop is exited if the expression becomes 0. The loop itself can be thought of as the statement ```{stmt expr3;}```. The third expression is executed at the end of each iteration; it is typically used to increment the loop index. The meaning of the for-statement is similar to
```
        expr1; while ( expr2 ) {stmt expr3; }
```
Define a class *For* for-statements, similar to class *If* in Fig. 2.43.

```
class For extends Stmt {
      Expr E1, Expr E2, Expr E3, Stmt S;
      public For(Expr expr1, Expr expr2, Expr expr3, Stmt stmt) {
            E1 = expr1; E2 = expr2; E3 = expr3; Stmt = stmt; start = newlabel(); end = newlabel();
      }
      public void gen() {
            E1.gen();
            Expr n = E2.rvalue();
            emit( "ifFalse " + n.toString() + " + " goto " + end);
            E3.gen();
            S.gen();
            emit("goto " + start);
            emit(end + ":");
      }
}
```

### 2.8.2
***
The programming language C does not have a boolean type. Show how a C compiler might translate an if-statement into three-address code.

### `Answer`
```
class If extends Stmt {
      Expr E; Stmt S;
      public If(Expr x, Stmt y) { E = x; S = y; after = newlabel(); }
      public void gen() {
            Expr n = E.rvalue();
            emit( "ifEqual " + n.toString() + " 0 goto " + after);
            S.gen();
            emit(after + ":");
      }
}
```
