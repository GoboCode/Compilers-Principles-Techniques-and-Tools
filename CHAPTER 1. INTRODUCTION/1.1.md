### 1.1.1
***
What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?

### `Answer`
A compiler is a program that can read a program in one language - the source language - and translate it into an equivalent program in another language - the target language. An important role of the compiler is to report any errors in the source program that it detects during the translation process. If the target program is an executable machine-language program, it can then be called by the user to process inputs and produce outputs.

An interpreter appears to directly execute the operations specified in the source program on inputs supplied by the user.

### 1.1.2
***
What are the advantages of (a) a compiler over an interpreter (b) an interpreter over a compiler?

### `Answer`
(a) The machine-language target program produced by a compiler is usually much faster than an interpreter at mapping inputs to outputs.

(b) An interpreter can usually give better error diagnostics than a compiler, because it executes the source program statement by statement.

### 1.1.3
***
What advantages are there to a language-processing system in which the compiler produces assembly language rather than machine language?

### `Answer`
The compiler may produce an assembly-language program as its output, because assembly language is easier to produce as output and is easier to debug.

### 1.1.4
***
A compiler that translates a high-level language into another high-level language is called a source-to-source translator. What advantages are there to using C as a target language for a compiler?

### `Answer`
There are many compilers available for C language that can be compiled on many platforms.

### 1.1.5
***
Describe some of the tasks that an assembler needs to perform.

### `Answer`
The assembly language is produced by a program called an assembler that produces relocatable machine code as its output.
