### 4.3.1
***
The following is a grammar for regular expressions over symbols *a* and *b* only, using + in place of | for union, to avoid conflict with the use of vertical bar as a metasymbol in grammars:
```
rexpr    -> rexpr + rterm | rterm
rterm    -> rterm rfactor | rfactor
rfactor  -> rfactor * | rprimary
rprimary -> a | b
```
a) Left factor this grammar.

b) Does left factoring make the grammar suitable for top-down parsing?

c) In addition to left factoring, eliminate left recursion from the original grammar.

d) Is the resulting grammar suitable for top-down parsing?

### `Answer`
a) This grammar cannot be left factored

b) No

c)
```
rexpr    -> rterm rexpr'
rexpr'   -> + rterm rexpr' | ε
rterm    -> rfactor rterm'
rterm'   -> rfactor rterm' | ε
rfactor  -> rprimary rfactor'
rfactor' -> * rfactor' | ε
primary  -> a | b
```

d) Yes

### 4.3.2
***
Repeat Exercise 4.3.1 on the following grammars:

a) The grammar of Exercise 4.2.1.

b) The grammar of Exercise 4.2.2(a).

c) The grammar of Exercise 4.2.2(c).

d) The grammar of Exercise 4.2.2(e).

e) The grammar of Exercise 4.2.2(g).

### `Answer`

a)
```
S  -> S S S' | a
S' -> + | *
```

b) No

c)
```
S  -> a S'
S' -> S + S' | S * S' | ε
```

d) Yes

b) ```S -> 0 S 1 | 0 1```

```
S  -> 0 S'
S' -> S 1 | 1
```

b) No

c) There is no left recursion in this grammar

d) Yes

c) ```S -> S ( S ) S | ε```

a) This grammar cannot be left factored

b) No

c)
```
S  -> S'
S' -> ( S ) S S' | ε
```

d) Yes

d) ```S -> ( L ) | a``` and ```L -> L , S | S```

a) This grammar cannot be left factored

b) No

c)
```
S  -> ( L ) | a
L  -> ( L ) L' | a L'
L' -> , ( L ) L' | , a L' | ε
```

d) Yes

e)
```
  bexpr -> bexpr or bterm | bterm
  bterm -> bterm and bfactor | bfactor
bfactor -> not bfactor | ( bexpr ) | true | false
```

a) This grammar cannot be left factored

b) No

c)
```
  bexpr -> bterm bexpr'
 bexpr' -> or bterm bexpr' | ε
  bterm -> bfactor bterm'
 bterm' -> and bfactor bterm' | ε
bfactor -> not bfactor | ( bexpr ) | true | false
```

d) Yes
