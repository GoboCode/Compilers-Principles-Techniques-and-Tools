### 3.1.1
***
Divide the following C++ program:
```
    float limitedSquare(x) float x; {
        /* returns x-squared, but never more than 100 */
        return (x<=-10.0||x>=10.0)?100:x*x;
    }
```
into appropriate lexemes, using the discussion of Section 3.1.2 as a guide. Which lexemes should get associated lexical values? What should those values be?

### `Answer`
```
<float> <id, limitedSquare> <(> <id, x> <)> <float> <id, x> <{>
<return> <(> <id, x> <op, "<="> <num, -10.0> <op, "||"> <id, x> <op, ">="> <num, 10.0> <)> <op, "?"> <num, 100> <op, ":"> <id, x> <op, "*"> <id, x>
```

### 3.1.2

Tagged languages like HTML or XML are different from conventional programming languages in that the punctuation (tags) are either very numerous (as in HTML) or a user-definable set (as in XML). Further, tags can often have parameters. Suggest how to divide the following HTML document:
```
    Here is a photo of <B>my house</B>:
    <P><IMG SRC = "house.gif"><BR>
    See <A HREF = "morePix.html">More Pictures</A> if you
    liked that one.<P>
```
into appropriate lexemes. Which lexemes should get associated lexical values, and what should those values be?

### `Answer`
```
<text, "Here is a photo of"> <nodestart, B> <text, "my house"> <nodeend, B>
<nodestart, "P"> <nodestart, IMG> <nodeparam, SRC> <=> <text, "house.gif"> <selfendnode, "BR">
<text, "See"> <nodestart, A> <nodeparam, HREF> <=> <text, "morePix.html"> <text, "More Pictures"> <nodeend, A> <text, "if you">
<text, liked that one."> <nodeend, P>
```
